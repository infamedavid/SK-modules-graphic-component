The componets are tagged wit the suffix "DK" and "LT" to differentiate the obscure components from the clear.

The Knobs coming in four sizes "big", "mid", "sml" and "tny" and each one is made up of two layers "layer_00" and "layer_01" 
both layers should be overlayed and in order to obtain the "achurado"  effect (it isthe spanish word for the a simulation of the light coming from upside) only the "layer_01" must rotate.

Other components are taged as "true" and "false"   to denote two  states of the same componet.
